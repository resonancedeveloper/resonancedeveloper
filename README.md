- 👋 Hi, We are the Developer team at The Resonance Labs - a tech startup that is being pursued as a hobby now. 
- 👀 Resonance (Let's Resonate) was a music social network App on the iOS - we'd be sharing some cool tech that we built for the benefit of the others. 
- 🌱 We've worked in iOS development (swift), AWS development in Java and dabble a bit with Html, CSS, Javascript and Python. We're experimenting with Azure currently. 
- 💞️ Cool tech
